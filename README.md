# Dart IndexOutOfBoundsException Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The error occurs when you try to access or modify an element of a list using an index that is not within the list's valid range (0 to length-1).

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

This is a simple example, but the same principle applies to more complex scenarios involving lists and arrays.
